Rockhouse was a beautiful place to grow up. Right on the edge of Kyneton, the Campaspe River meandering through the paddocks. That was a long time ago. Since then I've moved to Melbourne, grown up, and built a family of my own. The farm is still owned by the family, and is managed by Jon Marshall, he has been with us for 30 years.

Its funny how you take certain things for granted. You just assume that others are thinking the same things you are, and that they hear and agree with all your thoughts. Then one day someone asks what seems like a pretty simple question, and the penny drops.

Our family had one of these moments about 6 months ago, while talking about the future of the property that is so dear to all our hearts (yet we all seem to have moved away!), someone asked the simplest of questions:

"What happens to our animals once they're sold?"

There were a number of blank looks. Then the next question 'has anyone ever tasted the beef we produce?'

Its really quite embarrassing when I look back at this moment and realise, not only how little I understood about our farming operation and the fate of the animals we raised, but more importantly how I had absolved myself of any responsibility with regard to the overall viability of the farm and the ongoing welfare of those animals.

This was our first big small step.............

Two months later, we sent a young steer (pictured above) off to the abattoir, and then to the local butcher. This was the first time we had ever knowingly handled and tasted the food we produce from our property. And it marks an important point in the history of the Rockhouse property,
